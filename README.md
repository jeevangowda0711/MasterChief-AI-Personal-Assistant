# MasterChief-AI-Personal-Assistant

Your lifelong, renameable AI companion that lives one gesture away on every device.

**Final ATC Project – Team 2**  
**Presented: November 25, 2025**  
**Lead Designer:** Jeevan Gowda (@jeevangowda0711)

## Overview

**MasterChief** (default name: “Chief – instantly renameable to Jarvis, Maya, Mom, Buddy, etc.) is the world’s first true AI friend that eliminates all mental load across work and life.

It summons instantly with one gesture/tap/voice on any device (phone, watch, laptop, car) as a frosted transparent overlay, listens to every communication channel (Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram DMs, voice notes, photos of whiteboards), extracts tasks/events/commitments, understands your energy and context, auto-schedules your calendar, acts in other apps via APIs, and works fully offline with an on-device quantized LLM.

Privacy-first · User-owned data · Evolving warm personality · “Mind like water”

This repository contains the complete final design package that was presented today — no code yet, just the full vision, docs, and architecture ready for implementation.

## Key Differentiators

- One universal gesture summon across all devices (no app switching)
- Full-life coverage: work + personal + health + family + habits
- Offline-first LLM (capture, reason, schedule on a plane)
- Renameable, evolving personality (“Hey Chief” → “Hey Mom”)
- Acts in your apps (writes to Calendar, Notion, Health, Linear, etc.)
- Radical privacy: Trust Center, on-device processing, granular controls
- Feels like your smartest, kindest friend who never forgets
